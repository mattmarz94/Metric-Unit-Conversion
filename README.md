# Metric-Unit-Conversion

Are you always frustrated or confused when trying to convert the American measurement system to the Metric system that is used almost everywhere around the world? Well with this application I make it easy for you. Simply enter a number and it will convert it for you to or from either system. 

Working on this project I learned and enhanced my skills to create the DOM I would be using to create this application. 
I used eventlisteners, instead of using an onclick function in the HTML, so I used more javascript. 

I used the .value function in order to pull the correct value that was inputed inside of the application, so the variables can work properly.

Lastly, I worked with tertiary operators, and their actions "${}" to call certain functions in order for the equations to run properly.
